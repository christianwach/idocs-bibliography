### Description

The *i-Docs Bibliography* plugin provides a Custom Post Type with ACF Fields that allows you to build a Bibliography or Citation Archive.

#### Shortcodes

Individual Citations can be inserted into Posts or Pages with the `[idocs_citation]` Shortcode. Lists of Citations can be inserted into Posts or Pages with the `[idocs_citations]` Shortcode. Both Shortcodes work best with the Shortcake plugin. The Lists of Citations Shortcode can be manually configured by using attributes to filter by category ID and/or tag ID, e.g.

* `[idocs_citations category="2,3" tag="8,9,,11" relation="OR" /]`
* `[idocs_citations category="3" tag="4" relation="AND"]`
